CS-546 Lab 8
Palindromes: Part 1
For this lab, you will be using HTML, CSS, and Handlebars to make your first simple form! Your form will make a palindrome checker!

A palindrome is a phrase that is spelled the same way, backwards and forwards (ignoring spacing and punctuation; only alphanumeric characters matter). For example, the following phrases are palindromes:

Madam
Was it a cat I saw?
He did, eh?
Go hang a salami, Iâ€™m a lasagna hog.
Poor Dan is in a droop
Taco cat? Taco cat.
You will create an express server with two pages: / and /result; you will also have one static asset, /public/site.css.

http://localhost:3000/
This page will respond with a valid HTML document. The title of the document should be "The Best Palindrome Checker in the World!". You should have the title set as the <title> element of the HTML document and as an h1 in your document.

Your page should reference a CSS file, /public/site.css; this file should have at least 5 rulesetsthat apply to this page; these 5 rules can also apply to elements on /result, or be unique to this page.

You should have a main element, and inside of the main element have a p element with a brief (2-3 sentence description) of what a palindrome is, and what your website does.

Also inside the main element, you will have a form; this form will POST to /result. This form will have an input and a label; the label should properly reference the same idas the input. You should also have a button with a type of submit that submits the form. The input in your form should have a name of text-to-test. When your POST this string to /result, it will be checked to see if it is a palindrome or not.

http://localhost:3000/result
This page will respond with a valid HTML document. The title of the document should be "The Palindrome Results!". You should have the title set as the <title> element of the HTML document and as an h1 in your document.

Your page should reference a CSS file, /public/site.css; this file should have at least 5 rulesetsthat apply to this page; these 5 rules can also apply to elements on /, or be unique to this page. **You must have 2 classes: success and failure that are used to color the message below either #28a745 and #dc3545 respectively.

You should have a main element, and inside of the main element have a p tag that has the text-to-test in it. **If the text is a palindrome, this p tag will have a class of success; if it is not, it will have a class of failure. After the p tag, you will have another p tag that states whether or not the string was a palindrome.

You must also provide an a tag that links back to your / route with the text Try another palindrome.

If the user does not input text into their form, make sure to give a response status code of 400 on the page, and render an HTML page with a paragraph class called error; this paragraph should describe the error.

http://localhost:3000/public/site.css
This file should have 5 rulesets that apply to the / route, and 5 rulesets that apply to /result. Rulesets may be shared across both pages; for example, if you styled a p tag, it would count as 1 of the 5 for both pages.

You may include more than 5 rulesets if you so desire.
