    <h1>That Time I Made My First Dish</h1>
    <main>
        <p>My first solo cooking venture was making Baingan ka Bharta (Scrambled eggplant) (Thanks to YouTube/Kabita's kitchen). In this post I will share a few takeaways from my experience.</p>
        <p>Fennel seeds (saunf) looks just like cumin seeds (zeera) so don't add fennel seeds by mistake unless you want your dish to taste like Paan.</p>
        <p>Don't let "Why doesn't my dish look as good as the youtube lady's?" bring you down. Keep cookin'! You're crushin' it! If it doesn't taste fun, add a little ketchup but don't tell your roommate (or any cooking expert) that you did that. (Hehe). Also, if you are a novice chef, keep Burnol/bandage close at hand because you are bound to burn/cut yourself several times in the course of your (mis)adventure. Moreover, always buy a non-stick handi no matter how much the sweet, Indian aunty tells you that the steel pan would work. It won't.</p>
        <p>Finally, eat it with relish and gratitude however it tastes/looks. Happy cooking!</p>
