            <h2>University of Engineering & Technology (UET), Lahore, Pakistan</h2>
            <p>My favorite class in UET was "Digital Signal Processing" (DSP) by Prof. Dr. Asim Loan. He was a great teacher and was notorious for failing his students if they gave anything less than their very best. I loved how he made us work hard.</p>
            <aside>My most memorable memory from UET is when I conducted the first STEM Women's conference titled "STEM for All: Claiming an Education". In this conference, we invited inspiring women from different parts of the country to visit UET and share their stories.</aside>

            <h2>Kinnaird College for Women University (KC), Lahore, Pakistan</h2>
            <p>At KC, my favorite class was "Chemistry Lab" because of all the fun science adventures and (mis)adventures we did in it.</p>
            <aside>My most memorable memory from KC is sitting under a gigantic Banyan tree, which everyone called "The Big Tree" and reading novels on lazy summer afternoons.</aside>

            <h2>Beaconhouse School System (BSS), Lahore, Pakistan</h2>
            <p>At BSS, my favorite class was "Urdu" because our teacher used to tell us wonderful stories.</p>
            <aside>My most memorable memory from BSS is being part of the Debate Team.</aside>
